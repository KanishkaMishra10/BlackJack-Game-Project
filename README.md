# BlackJack-Game-Project

Created this as a Mini-Project in the initial semesters of College.

# About this Project

This is a game between a player and the dealer (computer). 
In this game, I have tried to replicate a casino by inserting a betting system and making use of face cards.

# About the game

Blackjack is the American variant of a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One, whose relatives include Pontoon and Vingt-et-Un. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other.

# Rules of the Game taken into consideration in this Project

* The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). 
* Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. 
* Aces can be worth one or eleven. 
* A hand's value is the sum of the card values. 
* Player is allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. Once the player has completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer's hand will not be completed if the player has either scored greater than 21 or received blackjacks. The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer must stay. 
* You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21.                                

The detailed outcome of the hand follows:

* If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a "blackjack"), and the dealer does not, the player wins.
* If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (when you went over); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.
* If the dealer exceeds 21 and the player does not; the player wins.
* If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and the sum doesnâ€™t exceeds 21; the player wins and Unbelievable! YOU WIN gets displayed
* If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, no one wins.
